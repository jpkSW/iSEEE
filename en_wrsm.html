      <p>Like the DC machine, the synchronous machine can also be excited via a current-carrying winding.</p>
      <p>Experiment with the torque via the slider "torque (p.u.)" and the excitation with the slider "field (p.u.)"! In addition, the value for the synchronous reactance p.u. <em>x</em> =
        <em>X</em><sub>S</sub>/(<em>U</em><sub>SN</sub>/<em>I</em><sub>SN</sub>) can be changed in the range of 1.05...1.5 with the arrow buttons in the equivalent circuit diagram. </p> 
      <p>Here the operation in a grid with constant voltage and constant frequency is considered.</p>

				  In the equivalent circuit diagram, the stator voltage <u><em>U</em></u><sub>S</sub> (green), the voltage drop at the synchronous choke j<em>X</em><sub>S</sub> <u><em>I</em></u><sub>S</sub> (red) and the field e.m.f. <u><em>U</em></u><sub>P</sub> (blue) are drawn with the same colors as in the voltage phasor diagram.
				  <br>
				  Observe the direction of the field e.m.f. pointer relative to the voltage drop across the synchronous choke compared to the direction of the rotor (exciter) field (blue vector in the animation) relative to the stator field (red vectors in the animation) and start the animation!

				  The load reference arrow system is assumed, i.e. a negative(!) torque drives the synchronous machine as a generator - the rotor poles "push" the stator poles ahead of them and the field e.m.f. phasor is leading ahead of the stator voltage phasor.<br>
				  Now slowly set the torque from -1.0 to 0.0! The field e.m.f. phasor now "moves" to the right, the stator poles approach the rotor poles.<br>
				  Now continue slowly setting the torque from 0.0 to +1.0! At positive torque, the load machine is driven - now the stator poles "push" the rotor poles in front of them and the stator voltage phasor is leading ahead of the field e.m.f. phasor.

				  Now slowly reduce the excitation!<br>
				  As long as the torque is not changed, the tip of the field e.m.f. phasor moves exactly vertically downwards and the current becomes smaller. This can be observed at two points: The length of the pointer j<em>X</em><sub>S</sub> <u><em>I</em></u><sub>S</sub> as well as the size of the red circles become smaller and reach a minimum when the phasor j<em>X</em><sub>S</sub> <u><em>I</em></u><sub>S</sub> is exactly horizontal or perpendicular to the stator voltage <u><em>U</em></u><sub>S</sub>. Up to this point, the current <u><em>I</em></u><sub>S</sub> is leading ahead of the voltage <u><em>U</em></u><sub>S</sub>: inductive reactive power is delivered to the grid and one speaks of overexcitation or overexcited operation.<br>
				  At the current minimum, the absorbed apparent power is pure active power. In generator mode the power factor cos &phi; = -1 and in motor mode cos &phi; = +1.<br>
				  If the excitation is reduced further, the current increases again and is lagging behind the voltage: inductive reactive power is absorbed from the mains/grid and one speaks of underexcitation or underexcited operation.

				  Now set the torque to zero!<br>
				  Even if you now adjust the excitation, all three voltage phasors as well as the stator and rotor poles each lie in one axis.<br>
				  In overexcited operation, the rotor field is weakened by the stator field: the north and south poles of stator and rotor are exactly opposite each other and inductive reactive power is delivered to the mains.<br>
				  In underexcited operation, inductive reactive power is absorbed from the mains and the rotor field is strengthened by the stator field: the north and south poles of the stator and the rotor are exactly opposite each other and inductive reactive power is absorbed from the mains for this purpose.
