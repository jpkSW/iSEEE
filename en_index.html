      <h3>Interactive Seminar "Introduction to Electromagnetic Energy Conversion" <br> (<u>i</u>nteraktives <u>S</u>eminar <u>E</u>inführung in die <u>E</u>lektromagnetische <u>E</u>nergiewandlung)</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>The first version was published already in 2005 as a simple website with half a dozen Flash animations on the homepage of the Laboratory for Electrical Machines of the 
        then FH Würzburg-Schweinfurt - in principle as a 
        <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/de/Massive_Open_Online_Course" target="_blank">MOOC (Massive Open Online
          Course)</a>, even if the designation did not yet exist at that time. </p>
      <p>With the introduction of a content management system for the FHWS website, own lab homepages were no longer possible, 
        so that the Flash animations were only available for FHWS students in the Moodle courses. 
        There, however, they were additionally didactically prepared in the form of lessons.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of 2021, Flash or the Flash Player is no longer supported by any Internet browser for security reasons and the animations had to be completely recreated in HTML5 or JavaScript. Scripts in ActionScript 2.0 on which the original animations are based cannot be automatically converted to HTML5.</p>
      <p>The already finished animations are linked below via the icons. The pale (unpunched) sheets show projects still in work/planning. The next step is to add the synchronous motor with electrical excitation. Nevertheless missing translations will be added shortly.</p>
