		<p>The equivalent circuit of the induction machine is usually shown either as a T-equivalen-circuit (T-EC) or, as in the first animation for the induction machine, as a Γ-equivalent-circuit (Γ-EC). The transmittions ratio is selected as the ratio of the number of windings in the first case (T-ESB) and the open-circuit voltage ratio with voltage-input from the stator side in the second case (Γ-ESB).</p>
		<p>If, on the other hand, the open-circuit voltage ratio with voltage-input from the rotor side is selected as the transmittion ratio, the inverse Γ-ESB shown is obtained.</p>
		<p> Here again the sliders are initially set so that an ideal lossless rotor winding is assumed and the rotor is at standstill. Also the operation in a grid with constant voltage and constant frequency is considered again.</p>

				  In this equivalent circuit diagram, the stator voltage <u><em>U</em></u><sub>S</sub> (green) has again been selected as the reference for the currents. The stator current <u><em>I</em></u><sub>S</sub> (red) is the same as in the original Γ-ECD, and it splits aganin into two current branches: the initial "no-load current" <u><em>I</em></u><sub>0</sub> now becomes the "direct current" <u><em>I</em></u><sub>d</sub> (green, very small in the starting point and almost not visible &#128527;), and the original "rotor current" <u><em>I</em></u><sub>R&#963;</sub> now becomes the "quadrature current" <u><em>I</em></u><sub>q</sub> (blue).
				  <br>
				  The two currents <u><em>I</em></u><sub>d</sub> and <u><em>I</em></u><sub>q</sub> must be perpendicular to each other (why?), with the "quadrature current" <u><em>I</em></u><sub>q</sub> in the inverse Γ-ECD being larger by exactly a factor of 1/(1&nbsp;-&nbsp;&sigma;) than the original "rotor current" <u><em>I</em></u><sub>R&#963;</sub> (why, really?).
				  <br>
				  Both currents (<u><em>I</em></u><sub>R&#963;</sub> and <u><em>I</em></u><sub>q</sub>) must be in phase, the factor <u><em>I</em></u><sub>R&#963;</sub> / <u><em>I</em></u><sub>q</sub> = 1/(1&nbsp;-&nbsp;&sigma;) is real. However, it is common to represent the stator current as the sum of direct and quadrature current in the inverse Γ-ECD, whereas in the Γ-ECD the no-load current is represented as the sum of stator and rotor current. Therefore, the two currents <u><em>I</em></u><sub>q</sub> and <u><em>I</em></u><sub>R&#963;</sub> are exactly opposite.
				  <br>
				  Start the animation and then vary only the speed, the frequency should not be changed yet!
				  <br>
				  You can observe that the cross current <u><em>I</em></u><sub>q</sub> (blue) always intersects the current curve at the no-load-point: So it has the same direction as the original "rotor current" <u><em>I</em></u><sub>R&#963;</sub> and is "longer" exactly by the amount that lies outside the current curve.

              <label class="tab-label" for="rd2">basic range (|n| ≤ 1) and frequency condition</label>
              <div class="tab-content">
				  Set the speed to 0.9 and then adjust the (stator) frequency to any value <em>f</em><sub>S</sub>&#8804;1!
				  <br>
				  Two parameters are adjusted at the same time:
				  <ul>
				  	<li>The difference between the stator frequency and the rotational speed remains constant at first, so that the rotor frequency also remains constant at first - the well-known frequency condition applies <em>f</em><sub>S</sub> = <em>f</em><sub>R</sub> + <em>p</em> &#183; <em>n</em>, respectively <em>f</em><sub>R</sub> = <em>f</em><sub>S</sub> - <em>p</em> &#183; <em>n</em>.</li>
					<li>In the basic range (|n| ≤ 1), the stator voltage <em>U</em><sub>S</sub> is adjusted in proportion to the frequency <em>f</em><sub>S</sub>: <em>U</em><sub>S</sub>/<em>f</em><sub>S</sub> = const.</li>
				  </ul>
				  If the rotor frequency remains constant, all three impedances change simultaneously in the equivalent circuit and thus the total impedance is also proportional to the stator frequency. However, if the stator voltage is also adjusted proportionally to the frequency, the stator current <u><em>I</em></u><sub>S</sub> = <u><em>U</em></u><sub>S</sub> / <u><em>Z</em></u><sub>ges</sub> also remains constant. The only things that change are the speed and the frequencies in the animation.
				  <br>
				  Now set the frequency <em>f</em><sub>S</sub> = 0! Is this plausible? Vary the speed at <em>f</em><sub>S</sub> = 0!

				  Set the speed again to 0.9 and then adjust the (stator) frequency to any value <em>f</em><sub>S</sub> &#62; 1!
				  <br>
				  Now only the speed is "pulled along", the stator voltage remains constant now.
				  <br><br>
				  Here, too, all three impedances in the equivalent circuitchange simultaneously and thus also the total impedance proportional to the stator frequency. However, if the stator voltage is now kept constant, the stator current becomes smaller in proportion to the frequency. At the same time, the current locus curve becomes smaller and shifts in the direction of the origin of the complex plane.
